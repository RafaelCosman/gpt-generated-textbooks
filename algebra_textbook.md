# 1. Introduction to Algebra


## A. Definition of Algebra


### What is Algebra?
Algebra is the branch of mathematics that deals with the study of symbols and the rules for manipulating those symbols. In algebra, we use symbols to represent numbers and unknowns, and use those symbols to form equations, inequalities, and other mathematical statements. Algebra is used to solve problems by finding unknown values, or to determine whether a statement is true or false.

### Symbols
Algebra uses symbols to represent numbers and unknowns. The most common symbols are:
- **Variables**: Variables are symbols that represent unknown values. Common variables are x, y, z, a, b, and c.
- **Constants**: Constants are symbols that represent known values. Common constants are numbers like 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.
- **Operators**: Operators are symbols that are used to perform operations on variables and constants. Common operators are + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), and / (division).

### Equations
An equation is a mathematical statement that two expressions are equal. An equation will have an equal sign (=) and two expressions on either side of the equal sign. For example:

```
2x + 4 = 10
```

In this equation, the left side (2x + 4) is equal to the right side (10). We can solve this equation by finding the value of x.

### Inequalities
An inequality is a mathematical statement that two expressions are not equal. An inequality will have an inequality sign (<, >, ≤, ≥) and two expressions on either side of the sign. For example:

```
2x + 4 > 10
```

In this inequality, the left side (2x + 4) is greater than the right side (10). We can solve this inequality by finding all values of x that make the inequality true.

### Examples
Let's look at a few examples of algebraic equations and inequalities:

1. **Equation**: 3x + 2 = 10
   - Solution: x = 4

2. **Inequality**: 2x + 4 < 10
   - Solution: x < 3

3. **Equation**: 2x<sup>2</sup> - 5x + 3 = 0
   - Solution: x = 1 or x = 3

4. **Inequality**: x<sup>2</sup> + 4x - 5 > 0
   - Solution: x > -1 and x < 5

### Practice Problems
Try solving the following algebraic equations and inequalities:

1. **Equation**: 5x - 4 = 16

2. **Inequality**: 3x - 7 < 11

3. **Equation**: x<sup>2</sup> + 5x - 6 = 0

4. **Inequality**: 2x<sup>2</sup> + 6x - 11 ≤ 0

### Summary
Algebra is the branch of mathematics that deals with the study of symbols and the rules for manipulating those symbols. Algebra uses variables, constants, and operators to form equations, inequalities, and other mathematical statements. By solving equations and inequalities, we can find unknown values and determine whether a statement is true or false.

## B. Overview of Algebraic Notation


### Notation Basics

Algebraic notation is a language used to express mathematical statements and equations. It is composed of symbols that represent operations, numbers, and variables. The most common symbols are:

- **+**: Addition
- **-**: Subtraction
- **\***: Multiplication
- **/**: Division
- **=**: Equals
- **<**: Less than
- **>**: Greater than
- **(**: Left parentheses
- **)**: Right parentheses

These symbols are used to describe relationships between numbers and variables. For example, the equation `5 + 3 = 8` can be written using algebraic notation as `5 + 3 = 8`.

### Variables

Variables are symbols that represent unknown values. In algebraic notation, variables are often represented by letters. For example, the equation `x + 3 = 8` can be written using algebraic notation as `x + 3 = 8`.

Variables can also represent more than one value. For example, the equation `x + y = 8` can be written using algebraic notation as `x + y = 8`.

### Exponents

Exponents are used to represent the number of times a number is multiplied by itself. In algebraic notation, exponents are written as superscripts. For example, the equation `2<sup>3</sup> = 8` can be written using algebraic notation as `2<sup>3</sup> = 8`.

### Order of Operations

When solving equations, it is important to remember the order of operations. This is the sequence in which operations should be performed when solving equations. The order of operations is:

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division
4. Addition and Subtraction

For example, the equation `2 + 3 \* 4 = 14` can be written using algebraic notation as `2 + 3 \* 4 = 14`.

### Example Problem

Let's try solving an equation using algebraic notation.

Given the equation `x + 7 = 12`, we can solve for `x` using the order of operations. First, we subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:

`x + 7 - 7 = 12 - 7`

`x = 5`

So, the solution to the equation `x + 7 = 12` is `x = 5`.

### Practice Problems

Try solving the following equations using algebraic notation:

1. `3x + 2 = 14`
2. `5y - 3 = 12`
3. `2<sup>3</sup> + 4 = 16`

Solutions:

1. `3x + 2 = 14`
`3x + 2 - 2 = 14 - 2`
`3x = 12`
`3x / 3 = 12 / 3`
`x = 4`

2. `5y - 3 = 12`
`5y - 3 + 3 = 12 + 3`
`5y = 15`
`5y / 5 = 15 / 5`
`y = 3`

3. `2<sup>3</sup> + 4 = 16`
`2<sup>3</sup> + 4 - 4 = 16 - 4`
`2<sup>3</sup> = 12`
`2<sup>3</sup> / 2 = 12 / 2`
`2<sup>2</sup> = 6`
`2<sup>2</sup> / 2 = 6 / 2`
`2 = 3`

## C. Types of Algebraic Expressions


### Expressions
An **expression** is a combination of numbers, variables, and operations that can be evaluated to a single numerical value. An expression does not contain an equals sign (=).

For example, the following are all expressions:

- `2 + 4`
- `x + 3`
- `3x - 2y`

### Equations
An **equation** is a statement that two expressions are equal. An equation contains an equals sign (=).

For example, the following are all equations:

- `2 + 4 = 6`
- `x + 3 = 5`
- `3x - 2y = 0`

### Inequalities
An **inequality** is a statement that two expressions are not equal. An inequality contains symbols other than an equals sign. The most common symbols used in inequalities are `<`, `>`, `≤`, and `≥`.

For example, the following are all inequalities:

- `2 + 4 < 6`
- `x + 3 > 5`
- `3x - 2y ≤ 0`

### Practice Problems

1. Evaluate the expression `5x + 3` when `x = 2`.

Answer: `11`

2. Solve the equation `2x + 5 = 17`.

Answer: `x = 6`

3. Solve the inequality `3x - 5 > 10`.

Answer: `x > 5`

## D. Order of Operations


### What is the Order of Operations?
The Order of Operations is a set of rules that dictate the sequence in which operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.) should be performed when evaluating an algebraic expression. It is also referred to as the "PEMDAS" rule, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction.

### Why is the Order of Operations Important?
The Order of Operations is important because it ensures that all algebraic expressions are evaluated in the same way, regardless of who is solving them. Without it, different people could solve the same expression in different ways and get different answers.

### Applying the Order of Operations
When solving an algebraic expression, it is important to follow the Order of Operations in order to get the correct answer. The following steps should be followed when applying the Order of Operations:

1. Simplify any expressions inside parentheses.
2. Evaluate any exponents (powers or roots).
3. Perform all multiplications and divisions from left to right.
4. Perform all additions and subtractions from left to right.

### Example
Let's look at a simple example to see how the Order of Operations works:

- `2 + 3 × 4`

In this expression, we have an addition and a multiplication. According to the Order of Operations, we should first perform the multiplication, and then the addition. So, the expression should be evaluated as follows:

- `2 + 3 × 4 = 2 + 12 = 14`

### Practice Problems
Now that you understand the Order of Operations, try solving the following practice problems:

1. `4 + 3 × 7`
2. `2 × (4 + 5)`
3. `4(2 + 3)`

Answers:
1. `4 + 3 × 7 = 4 + 21 = 25`
2. `2 × (4 + 5) = 2 × 9 = 18`
3. `4(2 + 3) = 4 × 5 = 20`

## E. Introduction to Variables

### What is a Variable?
A variable is a symbol that stands for an unknown number. It is used to represent a quantity that can change or vary. Variables are often used in algebraic equations or expressions to represent the unknown values that need to be solved for.

### Types of Variables
There are two types of variables: independent and dependent.

**Independent Variables** are the variables that are not affected by other variables in the equation. These are usually the variables that are used to represent the input values of the equation.

**Dependent Variables** are the variables that are affected by other variables in the equation. These are usually the variables that are used to represent the output values of the equation.

### Examples

Let's look at an example of a simple equation:

```js
y = 2x + 3
```

In this equation, `x` is the independent variable and `y` is the dependent variable. This equation can be read as "`y` is equal to `2x` plus `3`".

The value of `y` is dependent on the value of `x`. If `x` is `2`, then `y` is `7` (`2x` + `3` = `7`). If `x` is `4`, then `y` is `11` (`2x` + `3` = `11`).

### Practice Problems

1. What is the independent variable in the equation `y = 5x + 7`?
   - The independent variable in the equation `y = 5x + 7` is `x`.

2. What is the dependent variable in the equation `y = 5x + 7`?
   - The dependent variable in the equation `y = 5x + 7` is `y`.

3. If `x` is `3`, what is the value of `y` in the equation `y = 5x + 7`?
   - If `x` is `3`, the value of `y` in the equation `y = 5x + 7` is `18` (`5x` + `7` = `18`).

## F. Basic Algebraic Rules


### Commutative Property
The Commutative Property states that the order of numbers does not affect the result of an equation. This means that for any two numbers, a and b, the equation a + b = b + a. For example, if you have the equation 2 + 3 = 5, then the equation 3 + 2 = 5 as well.

### Associative Property
The Associative Property states that the grouping of numbers does not affect the result of an equation. This means that for any three numbers, a, b, and c, the equation (a + b) + c = a + (b + c). For example, if you have the equation (2 + 3) + 4 = 9, then the equation 2 + (3 + 4) = 9 as well.

### Distributive Property
The Distributive Property states that a number multiplied by the sum of two numbers is equal to the sum of two numbers multiplied by the first number. This means that for any three numbers, a, b, and c, the equation a(b + c) = ab + ac. For example, if you have the equation 2(3 + 4) = 14, then the equation 2(3) + 2(4) = 14 as well.

### Identity Property
The Identity Property states that any number multiplied by 1 is equal to the original number. This means that for any number, a, the equation a * 1 = a. For example, if you have the equation 3 * 1 = 3, then the equation 3 * 1 = 3 as well.

### Inverse Property
The Inverse Property states that any number multiplied by its inverse (the number that will result in 1 when multiplied) will result in 1. This means that for any number, a, the equation a * 1/a = 1. For example, if you have the equation 4 * 1/4 = 1, then the equation 4 * 1/4 = 1 as well.

### Practice Problems

1. Use the Commutative Property to solve the equation:
    - 6 + 4 =
    - Answer: 10

2. Use the Associative Property to solve the equation:
    - (4 + 5) + 3 =
    - Answer: 12

3. Use the Distributive Property to solve the equation:
    - 4(2 + 3) =
    - Answer: 20

4. Use the Identity Property to solve the equation:
    - 5 * 1 =
    - Answer: 5

5. Use the Inverse Property to solve the equation:
    - 6 * 1/6 =
    - Answer: 1

## G. Solving Algebraic Equations

### Overview

Solving algebraic equations is the process of finding the values of the unknown variables that make the equation true. It is a fundamental skill in algebra and can be used to solve a wide variety of problems.

### Basic Steps

The basic steps to solving an algebraic equation are:

1. Simplify the equation by combining like terms and rearranging the equation
2. Isolate the variable on one side of the equation
3. Solve the equation

For example, consider the equation `2x + 4 = 10`.

1. Simplify the equation by combining like terms: `2x = 6`
2. Isolate the variable on one side of the equation: `2x = 6 → x = 3`
3. Solve the equation: `x = 3`

### Types of Equations

There are several types of equations that can be solved in algebra. The most common are linear equations, quadratic equations, and polynomial equations.

#### Linear Equations

Linear equations are equations of the form `ax + b = c`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are constants. They can be solved by isolating the variable on one side of the equation and then solving for the value of the variable.

For example, consider the equation `2x + 4 = 10`.

1. Isolate the variable on one side of the equation: `2x = 6`
2. Solve the equation: `2x = 6 → x = 3`

#### Quadratic Equations

Quadratic equations are equations of the form `ax² + bx + c = 0`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are constants. They can be solved using the quadratic formula, which is `x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a`.

For example, consider the equation `x² + 5x + 6 = 0`.

1. Plug the values into the quadratic formula: `x = (-5 ± √(5² - 4(1)(6))) / 2(1)`
2. Solve the equation: `x = (-5 ± √(-19)) / 2 → x = -2 or x = 3`

#### Polynomial Equations

Polynomial equations are equations of the form `axⁿ + bxⁿ⁻¹ + ... + c = 0`, where `a`, `b`, ..., and `c` are constants. They can be solved using a variety of methods, such as factoring and the quadratic formula.

For example, consider the equation `x³ - 3x² + 4x - 12 = 0`.

1. Factor the equation: `(x - 3)(x² + x - 4) = 0`
2. Solve the equation: `x - 3 = 0 → x = 3` and `x² + x - 4 = 0 → x = -1 or x = 4`

### Summary

Solving algebraic equations is a fundamental skill in algebra. There are several types of equations that can be solved, including linear equations, quadratic equations, and polynomial equations. The basic steps to solving an algebraic equation are to simplify the equation, isolate the variable on one side of the equation, and then solve the equation.

## H. Applications of Algebra


### Introduction
Algebra is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a variety of problems. Algebra can be used to solve equations, graph functions, solve for unknown values, and more. In this section, we will explore some of the practical applications of algebra.

### Equations
One of the most common applications of algebra is solving equations. Equations are mathematical statements that use an equal sign to show that two expressions are equal. For example, the equation `2x + 3 = 7` can be used to find the value of `x`. By solving this equation, we can determine that `x = 2`.

### Graphing
Algebra can also be used to graph equations. Graphing equations can help us visualize the relationship between two variables. For example, the equation `y = 2x + 1` can be graphed to show the relationship between `x` and `y`.

### Unknown Values
Algebra can also be used to find unknown values. For example, if we have an equation such as `x + y = 10`, we can use algebra to find the values of `x` and `y`. By solving the equation, we can determine that `x = 5` and `y = 5`.

### Applications in Science

For example, algebra can be used to calculate the velocity of a moving object, calculate the area of a circle, or find the volume of a cylinder. Algebra can also be used to solve for unknowns in physics equations, such as finding the acceleration of an object given its mass and force.

### Applications in Business
Algebra can also be used in business applications. For example, algebra can be used to calculate the cost of a product given its cost and profit margin, calculate the total cost of a project given the cost of each individual item, or calculate the interest rate on a loan.

### Summary
Algebra is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a variety of problems. Algebra can be used to solve equations, graph functions, solve for unknown values, and more. Algebra is also used in a variety of scientific and business applications. With the right knowledge and practice, algebra can be a powerful tool for problem solving.

## I. Algebraic Problem Solving Strategies


### Analyzing the Problem

The first step to solving an algebraic problem is to carefully read and analyze the problem. This involves understanding what the problem is asking and what information is given. It is important to note any constraints or conditions given in the problem.

For example, consider the following problem:

> Find the value of x if 5x + 3 = 21

The first step is to identify the unknown variable (in this case, x). Then, identify the given information (in this case, 5x + 3 = 21).

### Formulating a Plan

Once you have identified the unknown and given information, you can begin to formulate a plan for solving the problem. This involves deciding which operations to use in order to isolate the unknown variable and solve for its value.

In the example problem, you can see that the goal is to isolate the x variable. To do this, you will need to use the inverse operation of addition, which is subtraction.

### Executing the Plan

Once you have formulated a plan, you can begin to execute it. This involves performing the necessary operations in order to solve for the unknown variable.

In the example problem, you can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to isolate the x variable:

5x + 3 = 21
-3 -3
5x = 18

Then, you can divide both sides by 5 to solve for x:

5x = 18
/5 /5
x = 3.6

### Verifying the Solution

The last step is to verify the solution. This involves plugging the value of the unknown variable back into the original equation to check that it is correct.

In the example problem, plugging in x = 3.6 yields:

5(3.6) + 3 = 21
18 + 3 = 21

Since 18 + 3 = 21, the solution is verified.

## J. Summary

# 2. Basic Algebraic Operations


## A. Addition and Subtraction of Algebraic Expressions


### Adding and Subtracting Algebraic Expressions

Algebraic expressions can be added and subtracted just like regular numbers. The only difference is that instead of dealing with numbers, we are dealing with variables and coefficients. To add or subtract algebraic expressions, we simply combine like terms.

#### Like Terms

Like terms are terms that have the same variable and the same exponent. For example, the terms 3x<sup>2</sup> and 4x<sup>2</sup> are like terms because they both have the same variable (x) and the same exponent (2).

#### Combining Like Terms

To combine like terms, we simply add or subtract the coefficients of the like terms. For example, if we have the expression 3x<sup>2</sup> + 4x<sup>2</sup>, we can combine the terms by adding the coefficients to get 7x<sup>2</sup>.

#### Examples

1. Simplify the expression 5x<sup>2</sup> + 4x + 6x<sup>2</sup>.

- First, we combine the like terms 5x<sup>2</sup> and 6x<sup>2</sup> to get 11x<sup>2</sup>.

- Then, we combine the remaining terms 4x and 11x<sup>2</sup> to get 11x<sup>2</sup> + 4x.

- Therefore, the simplified expression is 11x<sup>2</sup> + 4x.

2. Simplify the expression 5x<sup>2</sup> - 2x<sup>2</sup> + 4x - 8x<sup>2</sup>.

- First, we combine the like terms 5x<sup>2</sup> and 8x<sup>2</sup> to get -3x<sup>2</sup>.

- Then, we combine the remaining terms 2x<sup>2</sup> and 4x to get -3x<sup>2</sup> + 4x.

- Therefore, the simplified expression is -3x<sup>2</sup> + 4x.

#### Practice Problems

1. Simplify the expression 3x<sup>2</sup> + 4x + 5x<sup>2</sup>.

2. Simplify the expression 7x<sup>2</sup> - 6x<sup>2</sup> + 3x - 4x<sup>2</sup>.

## B. Multiplication of Algebraic Expressions

### Introduction

Multiplication of algebraic expressions is one of the most important operations in algebra. It is used to combine two or more terms into a single expression. It is also used to solve equations and simplify expressions.

### Basic Multiplication

The basic rule for multiplying two algebraic expressions is to multiply each term in one expression by each term in the other expression. This can be done by using the distributive property.

For example, to multiply the expressions `3x + 2y` and `4x - 5y`, we can use the distributive property to get:

```
(3x + 2y) * (4x - 5y)
= (3x * 4x) + (3x * -5y) + (2y * 4x) + (2y * -5y)
= 12x^2 - 15xy - 8xy - 10y^2
= 12x^2 - 23xy - 10y^2
```

### Multiplication of Monomials

When multiplying monomials, the result is a new monomial with a product of the numerical coefficients and a product of the literal coefficients.

For example, to multiply `2x^2` and `3x`, we can use the basic multiplication rule to get:

`2x^2 * 3x = 6x^3`

### Multiplication of Polynomials

When multiplying polynomials, the result is a new polynomial with a product of the numerical coefficients and a product of the literal coefficients.

For example, to multiply `2x^2 + 3x + 4` and `3x^2 - 5x + 2`, we can use the basic multiplication rule to get:

```
(2x^2 + 3x + 4) * (3x^2 - 5x + 2)
= (2x^2 * 3x^2) + (2x^2 * -5x) + (2x^2 * 2) + (3x * 3x^2) + (3x * -5x) + (3x * 2) + (4 * 3x^2) + (4 * -5x) + (4 * 2)
= 6x^4 - 10x^3 + 4x^2 - 15x^2 + 6x + 8x - 10x + 8
= 6x^4 - 25x^3 + 10x^2 + 8
```

### Practice Problems

1. Multiply `3x^2 + 2x - 5` and `4x + 7`.

```
(3x^2 + 2x - 5) * (4x + 7)
= (3x^2 * 4x) + (3x^2 * 7) + (2x * 4x) + (2x * 7) + (-5 * 4x) + (-5 * 7)
= 12x^3 + 21x^2 + 8x - 35
```

2. Multiply `2x^3 - 7x` and `3x + 4`.

```
(2x^3 - 7x) * (3x + 4)
= (2x^3 * 3x) + (2x^3 * 4) + (-7x * 3x) + (-7x * 4)
= 6x^4 + 8x^3 - 21x^2 - 28x
```

3. Multiply `3x^2 - 4x + 7` and `x^3 - 2x + 3`.

```
(3x^2 - 4x + 7) * (x^3 - 2x + 3)
= (3x^2 * x^3) + (3x^2 * -2x) + (3x^2 * 3) + (-4x * x^3) + (-4x * -2x) + (-4x * 3) + (7 * x^3) + (7 * -2x) + (7 * 3)
= 3x^5 - 6x^4 + 9x^3 - 8x^2 + 21x - 21
```

## C. Division of Algebraic Expressions

### Basic Division

Division is the inverse operation of multiplication. Therefore, when we divide algebraic expressions, we are essentially undoing the multiplication that was done. We can think of division as equal groups or as fractions.

For example, if we divide `a` by `b`, it can be written as:

`a/b`

or

`a ÷ b`

or

`a ÷ b = c`

where `c` is the result of the division.

In algebraic expressions, the division is done in the same way. For example, if we divide `2x` by `x`, we get `2`.

`2x ÷ x = 2`

We can also divide algebraic expressions with more than one term. For example, if we divide `3x + 5` by `x`, we get `3 + 5/x`.

`3x + 5 ÷ x = 3 + 5/x`

### Dividing Monomials

When we divide monomials, we are essentially dividing each term in the monomial by the divisor. For example, if we divide `2x^2y` by `x`, we get `2xy`.

`2x^2y ÷ x = 2xy`

We can also divide monomials with more than one term. For example, if we divide `3x^2y + 5x` by `x`, we get `3xy + 5`.

`3x^2y + 5x ÷ x = 3xy + 5`

### Dividing Polynomials

When we divide polynomials, we are essentially dividing each term in the polynomial by the divisor. For example, if we divide `4x^2 + 3x + 2` by `2x`, we get `2x + 3/2 + 1/x`.

`4x^2 + 3x + 2 ÷ 2x = 2x + 3/2 + 1/x`

We can also divide polynomials with more than one term. For example, if we divide `3x^2 + 5x + 7` by `x + 1`, we get `3x + 5 - 7/x + 1`.

`3x^2 + 5x + 7 ÷ (x + 1) = 3x + 5 - 7/x + 1`

### Practice Problems

1. Divide `6x + 4` by `2x`.

`6x + 4 ÷ 2x = 3 + 2/x`

2. Divide `4x^2 + 5x` by `x`.

`4x^2 + 5x ÷ x = 4x + 5`

3. Divide `3x^2 + 7x + 5` by `2x + 1`.

`3x^2 + 7x + 5 ÷ (2x + 1) = 3x + 7 - 5/2x + 1`

## D. Exponents and Roots


### Exponents

Exponents are shorthand for repeated multiplication. In algebra, we use exponents to represent repeated multiplication of the same number. For example, the expression `3^2` means "3 multiplied by itself 2 times". In other words, it means 3x3, which is 9.

The base number is written first, followed by the exponent, which is written as a small, raised number. The exponent tells us how many times the base number is multiplied by itself.

We can also use exponents to represent very large numbers. For example, `10^6` means 10 multiplied by itself 6 times, which is 1,000,000.

We can also use negative exponents. For example, `2^-3` means 1 divided by 2 multiplied by itself 3 times, which is 1/8.

### Roots

Roots are the opposite of exponents. In algebra, we use roots to represent the inverse of an exponent. For example, the expression `√9` means "the number that when multiplied by itself will give us 9". In other words, it means 3.

The number inside the radical symbol is written first, followed by the root, which is written as a small, raised number. The root tells us how many times the number inside the radical symbol is multiplied by itself.

We can also use roots to represent fractions. For example, `√2/3` means the number that when multiplied by itself will give us 2, divided by 3. In other words, it means the square root of 2 divided by 3, which is 0.816.

We can also use fractional exponents, which are equivalent to roots. For example, `2^(1/3)` means the number that when multiplied by itself 3 times will give us 2. In other words, it means the cube root of 2, which is 1.259.

### Practice Problems

6. Simplify the expression `2^(1/3)`

- Answer: 1.259

## E. Order of Operations


### Introduction to Order of Operations

Order of operations is an important concept in algebra that helps us solve equations and simplify expressions. It is a set of rules that tells us the order in which we should perform operations when solving equations or simplifying expressions. The order of operations is often abbreviated as PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction.

### The Rules of Order of Operations

The rules of order of operations are as follows:

1. Parentheses: Any operations inside parentheses should be done first.
2. Exponents: Any operations involving exponents should be done second.
3. Multiplication and Division: Any operations involving multiplication and division should be done in order from left to right.
4. Addition and Subtraction: Any operations involving addition and subtraction should be done in order from left to right.

### Examples

Let's look at a few examples to illustrate the order of operations.

1. Simplify the expression `2 + 3 * 4`.

Using the order of operations, we first do the multiplication, `3 * 4 = 12`, and then the addition, `2 + 12 = 14`. So the answer is `14`.

2. Simplify the expression `(2 + 3) * 4`.

Using the order of operations, we first do the parentheses, `2 + 3 = 5`, and then the multiplication, `5 * 4 = 20`. So the answer is `20`.

3. Simplify the expression `2^3 * 4`.

Using the order of operations, we first do the exponents, `2^3 = 8`, and then the multiplication, `8 * 4 = 32`. So the answer is `32`.

4. Simplify the expression `2 + 3^2`.

Using the order of operations, we first do the exponents, `3^2 = 9`, and then the addition, `2 + 9 = 11`. So the answer is `11`.

### Practice Problems

1. Simplify the expression `2 * 5 + 3`.

2. Simplify the expression `(3 + 5)^2`.

3. Simplify the expression `3 * (4 + 5)`.

4. Simplify the expression `2^2 + 4^2`.

## F. Combining Like Terms


### Introduction

Combining like terms is an important algebraic operation that allows us to simplify expressions and equations. In order to combine like terms, we must first identify the terms that are "like" each other. Like terms are terms that contain the same variables raised to the same powers. For example, the terms 4x<sup>2</sup> and -2x<sup>2</sup> are like terms because they both contain the same variable (x) raised to the same power (2).

### Combining Like Terms

The process of combining like terms is relatively straightforward. To combine like terms, we simply add or subtract the coefficients of the terms. For example, consider the expression 4x<sup>2</sup> + 6x - 2x<sup>2</sup>. In this expression, the terms 4x<sup>2</sup> and -2x<sup>2</sup> are like terms, so we can combine them by adding the coefficients:

4x<sup>2</sup> + 6x - 2x<sup>2</sup> = (4 + -2)x<sup>2</sup> + 6x = 2x<sup>2</sup> + 6x

We can also combine like terms that are multiplied together. For example, consider the expression 2x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup> - 4x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup>. In this expression, the terms 2x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup> and -4x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup> are like terms, so we can combine them by adding the coefficients:

2x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup> - 4x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup> = (2 + -4)x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup> = -2x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup>

### Examples

Let's look at a few examples of combining like terms.

**Example 1**

Simplify the expression 5x<sup>2</sup> + 6x - 3x<sup>2</sup>.

Solution: 5x<sup>2</sup> + 6x - 3x<sup>2</sup> = (5 - 3)x<sup>2</sup> + 6x = 2x<sup>2</sup> + 6x

**Example 2**

Simplify the expression 3x<sup>2</sup>y + 4x<sup>2</sup>y - 2xy.

Solution: 3x<sup>2</sup>y + 4x<sup>2</sup>y - 2xy = (3 + 4)x<sup>2</sup>y - 2xy = 7x<sup>2</sup>y - 2xy

### Practice Problems

Try the following practice problems to test your knowledge of combining like terms.

1. Simplify the expression 3x<sup>2</sup> + 5x - 2x<sup>2</sup>.

2. Simplify the expression 4x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup> - 6x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup>.

3. Simplify the expression 8x<sup>2</sup>y + 2xy - 4x<sup>2</sup>y.

### Answers

1. 3x<sup>2</sup> + 5x - 2x<sup>2</sup> = (3 - 2)x<sup>2</sup> + 5x = x<sup>2</sup> + 5x
2. 4x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup> - 6x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup> = (4 - 6)x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup> = -2x<sup>2</sup>y<sup>3</sup>
3. 8x<sup>2</sup>y + 2xy - 4x<sup>2</sup>y = (8 + 2)x<sup>2</sup>y - 4x<sup>2</sup>y = 10x<sup>2</sup>y - 4x<sup>2</sup>y

## G. Simplifying Algebraic Expressions


### What is Simplifying?

Simplifying an algebraic expression is the process of combining like terms and removing any unnecessary factors or operations. This process can be used to reduce a complex expression to its simplest form.

### How to Simplify

When simplifying an expression, there are a few steps to follow:

1. Combine like terms:
   - Look for terms that have the same variable, coefficient, and exponent and combine them.
   - For example, if you have `2x^2 + 3x^2`, combine them to get `5x^2`.
2. Remove parentheses:
   - If there are any parentheses, remove them and distribute the coefficient or exponent to the terms inside.
   - For example, if you have `2(x+3)`, remove the parentheses to get `2x + 6`.
3. Factor out common factors:
   - If there are any common factors, factor them out and put them in front of the expression.
   - For example, if you have `2x^2 + 4x`, factor out the common factor of `2` to get `2(x^2 + 2x)`.
4. Simplify exponents:
   - If there are any exponents, simplify them using the rules of exponents.
   - For example, if you have `x^2 * x^3`, simplify the exponents to get `x^5`.

### Examples

Let's take a look at some examples of simplifying expressions:

**Example 1**

Simplify `2x^2 + 3x + 5x^2`.

Solution:

Combine like terms: `2x^2 + 5x^2 = 7x^2`.

Remove parentheses: No parentheses, so nothing to do here.

Factor out common factors: No common factors, so nothing to do here.

Simplify exponents: No exponents, so nothing to do here.

Final answer: `7x^2 + 3x`.

**Example 2**

Simplify `2(x + 3) + 4x^2`.

Solution:

Combine like terms: No like terms, so nothing to do here.

Remove parentheses: `2x + 6 + 4x^2`.

Factor out common factors: No common factors, so nothing to do here.

Answers:

1. `2x^2 + 5x`
2. `2x + 12 + 3x^2`
3. `5x^2 + 3x`

## H. Solving Multi-Step Equations


### Definition
A multi-step equation is an equation that requires more than one step to solve. It may involve combining like terms, taking the inverse of both sides of the equation, or using the distributive property.

### Examples
Here are some examples of multi-step equations:

1. 4x + 7 = 11
2. 3x + 2 = 11
3. 2x + 5 - 3x = 18
4. 2x - 5 + 7x = -3

### Solving Multi-Step Equations
The steps for solving multi-step equations are as follows:

1. Simplify each side of the equation by combining like terms.
2. Use inverse operations to isolate the variable.
3. Solve the equation.

Let's look at the first example: 4x + 7 = 11

1. Simplify each side of the equation by combining like terms: 4x + 7 = 11
2. Use inverse operations to isolate the variable: 4x + 7 - 7 = 11 - 7
3. Solve the equation: 4x = 4
4. Divide both sides by the coefficient of the variable: x = 1

### Practice Problems

1. Solve the equation: 5x + 4 = 11

  1. Simplify each side of the equation by combining like terms: 5x + 4 = 11
  2. Use inverse operations to isolate the variable: 5x + 4 - 4 = 11 - 4
  3. Solve the equation: 5x = 7
  4. Divide both sides by the coefficient of the variable: x = 1.4

2. Solve the equation: 3x - 7 = 18

  1. Simplify each side of the equation by combining like terms: 3x - 7 = 18
  2. Use inverse operations to isolate the variable: 3x - 7 + 7 = 18 + 7
  3. Solve the equation: 3x = 25
  4. Divide both sides by the coefficient of the variable: x = 8.33

## I. Solving Inequalities


### Introduction

Inequalities are mathematical expressions that involve the comparison of two values. These expressions can be written in the form of an equation, with the inequality symbol replacing the equals sign. Inequalities can be used to determine whether or not a given value is greater than, less than, or equal to another value.

### Types of Inequalities

There are four types of inequalities:

- **Greater than:** `a > b` means that a is greater than b.

- **Less than:** `a < b` means that a is less than b.

- **Greater than or equal to:** `a >= b` means that a is greater than or equal to b.

- **Less than or equal to:** `a <= b` means that a is less than or equal to b.

### Solving Inequalities

Solving inequalities is similar to solving equations, except that the inequality symbol must be taken into account.

#### Addition and Subtraction

When adding or subtracting a value from both sides of an inequality, the inequality symbol remains unchanged.

For example, if we are given the inequality `x + 2 > 5`, we can subtract 2 from both sides to get `x > 3`.

#### Multiplication and Division

When multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality by a positive value, the inequality symbol remains unchanged.

For example, if we are given the inequality `2x < 10`, we can divide both sides by 2 to get `x < 5`.

When multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality by a negative value, the inequality symbol is reversed.

For example, if we are given the inequality `x > 8`, we can multiply both sides by -1 to get `-x < -8`.

#### Solving Inequalities with Variables on Both Sides

When solving an inequality with variables on both sides, we must isolate the variable on one side. This is done by performing the same operations on both sides of the inequality.

For example, if we are given the inequality `4x + 2 > 10`, we can subtract 2 from both sides to get `4x > 8`. We can then divide both sides by 4 to get `x > 2`.

### Graphing Inequalities

Inequalities can be graphed on a number line or a coordinate plane. When graphing an inequality on a number line, the inequality symbol is used to indicate which side of the line contains the solution.

For example, if we are given the inequality `x > 2`, we can graph it on a number line by drawing an arrow pointing to the right at 2, indicating that all values greater than 2 are part of the solution.

When graphing an inequality on a coordinate plane, the solution is represented by a shaded region. The inequality symbol is used to determine which side of the line is shaded.

For example, if we are given the inequality `y ≥ 2`, we can graph it on a coordinate plane by shading the region above the line, indicating that all values greater than or equal to 2 are part of the solution.

### Practice Problems

1. Solve the inequality `3x + 5 > 12`.

Answer: `x > 3`

2. Graph the inequality `x < -2` on a number line.

Answer: ![Number Line](https://i.imgur.com/PZoUd7p.png)

3. Graph the inequality `y > -3` on a coordinate plane.

# 3. Algebraic Equations


## A. Definition of an Algebraic Equation

### What is an Algebraic Equation?
An algebraic equation is a mathematical equation involving one or more variables. A variable is a symbol, usually a letter, that stands for an unknown quantity. Algebraic equations are used to describe relationships between variables and to solve for unknown values.

### Types of Algebraic Equations
Algebraic equations can be divided into two categories: linear equations and nonlinear equations.

#### Linear Equations
Linear equations are equations in which the highest degree of the variable is one. This means that the equation will not contain any terms with exponents greater than one. Examples of linear equations include:

- 2x + 3 = 5
- 3y - 7 = 11
- x + y = 5

#### Nonlinear Equations
Nonlinear equations are equations in which the highest degree of the variable is greater than one. This means that the equation will contain terms with exponents greater than one. Examples of nonlinear equations include:

- x<sup>2</sup> + 2x + 1 = 0
- y<sup>3</sup> - 5y<sup>2</sup> + 2y + 7 = 0
- 3x<sup>2</sup> + 4y<sup>2</sup> + 5 = 0

### Solving Algebraic Equations
The goal of solving an algebraic equation is to find the value or values of the variable that make the equation true. This can be done by using various techniques, such as the distributive property, inverse operations, substitution, and the quadratic formula.

#### Example
Let's look at an example of solving an algebraic equation. Consider the equation x + 3 = 7. To solve this equation, we need to find the value of x that makes the equation true.

We can solve this equation by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

x + 3 = 7
-3 -3
x = 4

Therefore, the value of x that makes the equation true is 4.

#### Practice Problems
1. Solve the equation 2x + 1 = 5.
2. Solve the equation y<sup>2</sup> + 3y - 4 = 0.
3. Solve the equation 4x - 2 = 10.

#### Answers
1. x = 2
2. y = 1 or y = -4
3. x = 6

## B. Types of Algebraic Equations

### Linear Equations
Linear equations are equations with one or more variables that can be written in the form `ax + b = 0`, where `a` and `b` are constants and `x` is a variable. A linear equation can have any number of terms, but all terms must be of the same degree (or power) of the variable. For example, the equation `2x + 3 = 5` is a linear equation, while `2x^2 + 3 = 5` is not.

Linear equations can be solved using a variety of methods, including graphing, substitution, and elimination. Graphing can be used when the equation is written in the form `y = mx + b`, where `m` and `b` are constants. Substitution is used when one of the variables can be isolated and solved for. Elimination is used when two equations are combined to eliminate one of the variables.

### Quadratic Equations
Quadratic equations are equations with one or more variables that can be written in the form `ax^2 + bx + c = 0`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are constants and `x` is a variable. A quadratic equation can have any number of terms, but all terms must be of the same degree (or power) of the variable. For example, the equation `2x^2 + 3x + 5 = 0` is a quadratic equation, while `2x^3 + 3x + 5 = 0` is not.

Quadratic equations can be solved using a variety of methods, including factoring, graphing, and the quadratic formula. Factoring is used when the equation can be factored into two linear equations. Graphing can be used when the equation is written in the form `y = ax^2 + bx + c`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are constants. The quadratic formula is used when the equation cannot be factored and must be solved using an algebraic method.

### Polynomial Equations
Polynomial equations are equations with one or more variables that can be written in the form `ax^n + bx^(n-1) + ... + c = 0`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are constants and `x` is a variable. A polynomial equation can have any number of terms, but all terms must be of the same degree (or power) of the variable. For example, the equation `2x^3 + 3x^2 + 5x + 7 = 0` is a polynomial equation, while `2x^3 + 3x^2 + 5x^(1/2) + 7 = 0` is not.

Polynomial equations can be solved using a variety of methods, including factoring, graphing, and the quadratic formula. Factoring is used when the equation can be factored into linear or quadratic equations. Graphing can be used when the equation is written in the form `y = ax^n + bx^(n-1) + ... + c`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are constants. The quadratic formula is used when the equation cannot be factored and must be solved using an algebraic method.

### Rational Equations
Rational equations are equations with one or more variables that can be written in the form `p(x)/q(x) = 0`, where `p(x)` and `q(x)` are polynomial equations. A rational equation can have any number of terms, but all terms must be polynomials. For example, the equation `2x^3 + 3x^2 + 5x + 7 / (x^2 + 1) = 0` is a rational equation, while `2x^3 + 3x^2 + 5x + 7 / (x^2 + x + 1) = 0` is not.

Rational equations can be solved using a variety of methods, including factoring, graphing, and the quadratic formula. Factoring is used when the equation can be factored into linear, quadratic, or polynomial equations. Graphing can be used when the equation is written in the form `y = p(x)/q(x)`, where `p(x)` and `q(x)` are polynomial equations. The quadratic formula is used when the equation cannot be factored and must be solved using an algebraic method.

### Radical Equations
Radical equations are equations with one or more variables that can be written in the form `

## C. Simplifying Algebraic Equations


### What is Simplifying?

Simplifying an algebraic equation is the process of rewriting a given equation in a simpler form. This process is also referred to as "reducing" or "simplifying an expression". It involves rearranging the terms of the equation and combining like terms.

### Examples

Let's start with a simple example. Consider the equation:

```
2x + 3 - x = 5
```

We can simplify this equation by combining like terms:

```
2x + 3 - x = 5
2x + 3 - 3 = 5
2x = 2
x = 1
```

In this example, we combined the two x terms and the three terms to get the simplified equation.

Now let's look at a more complex example. Consider the equation:

```
2x + 5y - 3x + 4y = 6
```

We can simplify this equation by combining like terms:

```
2x + 5y - 3x + 4y = 6
2x - 3x + 5y + 4y = 6
-x + 9y = 6
x = 6 - 9y
```

In this example, we combined the two x terms and the two y terms to get the simplified equation.

### Practice

Now that you've seen some examples of simplifying equations, let's try some practice problems.

1. Simplify the equation:

```
3x + 4y - 2x + 7y = 10
```

Answer:
```
3x + 4y - 2x + 7y = 10
1x + 11y = 10
x = 10 - 11y
```

2. Simplify the equation:

```
2x + 3y - y + 5x = 7
```

Answer:
```
2x + 3y - y + 5x = 7
2x + 2y + 5x = 7
7x + 2y = 7
x = 7 - 2y/7
```

## D. Solving Algebraic Equations


### Introduction
Solving algebraic equations is an important skill in algebra. An algebraic equation is an equation that contains one or more terms that involve a variable. Solving an equation means finding the value of the variable that makes the equation true. In this section we will discuss how to solve algebraic equations.

### Basic Steps
The basic steps for solving an algebraic equation are as follows:

1. Simplify the equation by combining like terms and/or using the distributive property.
2. Isolate the variable on one side of the equation.
3. Solve the equation.

### Simplifying the Equation
The first step in solving an algebraic equation is to simplify the equation by combining like terms and/or using the distributive property. For example, consider the following equation:

```
2x + 5 = 7x – 3
```

We can simplify this equation by combining like terms and using the distributive property:

```
2x + 5 = 7x – 3
2x + 7x = 5 + 3
9x = 8
x = 8/9
```

### Isolating the Variable
The second step in solving an algebraic equation is to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. This is done by using inverse operations. Inverse operations are operations that “undo” each other. The inverse of addition is subtraction, and the inverse of multiplication is division.

For example, consider the equation:

```
2x + 5 = 7x – 3
```

We can isolate the variable by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:

```
2x + 5 - 5 = 7x – 3 - 5
2x = 7x – 8
2x - 7x = -8
-5x = -8
x = 8/5
```

### Solving the Equation
The third and final step in solving an algebraic equation is to solve the equation. This is done by substituting the value of the variable into the equation and solving for the unknown.

For example, consider the equation:

```
2x + 5 = 7x – 3
```

We can solve this equation by substituting 8/5 for x and solving for the unknown:

```
2(8/5) + 5 = 7(8/5) – 3
16/5 + 5 = 56/5 – 3
21/5 = 53/5
21/5 - 53/5 = 0
0 = 0
```

### Practice Problems
Now that we have discussed how to solve algebraic equations, let's practice with some examples.

1. Solve the following equation:

```
4x + 7 = 3x + 15
```

Solution:

We can solve this equation by isolating the variable on one side of the equation:

```
4x + 7 = 3x + 15
4x - 3x = 15 - 7
x = 8
```

2. Solve the following equation:

```
2x + 3 = 7x – 4
```

Solution:

We can solve this equation by isolating the variable on one side of the equation:

```
2x + 3 = 7x – 4
2x - 7x = -4 - 3
-5x = -7
x = 7/5
```

## E. Using the Distributive Property


### What is the Distributive Property?

The distributive property is an important tool in algebra that allows us to simplify and manipulate equations. It states that when a number is multiplied by a group of terms, the number can be distributed to each term in the group. This means that the number can be multiplied by each term separately, and then the results can be added together.

For example, if we have the equation:

```
2x(x + 3)
```

Using the distributive property, we can rewrite this equation as:

```
2x * x + 2x * 3
```

Which can then be simplified to:

```
2x² + 6x
```

### Examples of the Distributive Property

The distributive property can be used to simplify and solve many equations. Here are a few examples of how it can be used:

- **Simplifying equations:**

For example, if we have the equation:

```
2(x + 3) + 4(x + 3)
```

We can use the distributive property to simplify it to:

```
2x + 6 + 4x + 12
```

Which can then be simplified to:

```
6x + 18
```

- **Solving equations:**

The distributive property can also be used to solve equations. For example, if we have the equation:

```
2x + 3 = 15
```

We can use the distributive property to solve it by first subtracting 3 from both sides:

```
2x + 3 - 3 = 15 - 3
```

Which simplifies to:

```
2x = 12
```

Then, we can divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:

```
2x/2 = 12/2
```

Which simplifies to:

```
x = 6
```

### Practice Problems

1. Simplify the equation `3(x + 4) - 5(x + 4)`

2. Solve the equation `3x + 9 = 24`

Answer: `x = 7`

3. Simplify the equation `2(2x + 3) + 3(2x + 3)`

Answer: `5x + 9`

## F. Using the Order of Operations

### What is the Order of Operations?
The Order of Operations is the set of rules that tells us the order in which we should perform calculations when solving an algebraic equation. It is also commonly referred to as PEMDAS, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, and Subtraction.

### Why is the Order of Operations Important?
The Order of Operations is important because it ensures that we get the correct answer when solving an equation. Without following the Order of Operations, we may get an incorrect answer.

### How is the Order of Operations Used?
The Order of Operations is used when solving algebraic equations. It tells us the order in which to perform the operations, such as multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction.

### Examples
Let's look at a few examples of using the Order of Operations to solve algebraic equations.

- Example 1: Solve the equation: 2 + 3 * 4

In this equation, we should first do the multiplication (3 * 4) before the addition (2 +). The answer is 14.

- Example 2: Solve the equation: (2 + 3) * 4

In this equation, we should first do the addition (2 + 3) before the multiplication (* 4). The answer is 20.

- Example 3: Solve the equation: 4 + 2 * 3 - 6

In this equation, we should first do the multiplication (2 * 3) before the addition (4 +). Then, we should do the subtraction (6 -) after the addition. The answer is 4.

### Practice Problems
Now let's practice using the Order of Operations to solve some equations.

1. Solve the equation: 5 + 7 * 2

Answer: 19

2. Solve the equation: (4 + 6) * 3

Answer: 42

3. Solve the equation: 8 - 4 * 3 + 2

Answer: 2

## G. Using Algebraic Identities

### What are Algebraic Identities?
Algebraic identities are equations that are true for all values of their variables. They are also known as “equational identities” or “identity equations” and are used to simplify equations.

### Types of Algebraic Identities
There are several types of algebraic identities, including:
- **Commutative Property**: This states that the order of the terms in a mathematical expression does not matter. For example, a + b = b + a.
- **Associative Property**: This states that the order in which operations are performed does not matter. For example, (a + b) + c = a + (b + c).
- **Distributive Property**: This states that when two numbers are multiplied together, the product is equal to the sum of the individual products of each number. For example, a(b + c) = ab + ac.
- **Identity Property**: This states that any number multiplied by one is equal to itself. For example, a * 1 = a.
- **Inverse Property**: This states that any number divided by itself is equal to one. For example, a/a = 1.
- **Zero Property**: This states that any number multiplied by zero is equal to zero. For example, a * 0 = 0.

### Examples
Let's look at some examples of how to use algebraic identities to simplify equations.

**Example 1**: Simplify the equation 4x + 5 + 2x.

Using the commutative property, we can rearrange the terms in the equation:

4x + 2x + 5 = (4x + 2x) + 5 = 6x + 5

**Example 2**: Simplify the equation (4x + 5) + (2x + 3).

Using the associative property, we can rearrange the terms in the equation:

(4x + 5) + (2x + 3) = 4x + (5 + 2x) + 3 = 4x + (2x + 5) + 3 = 4x + 7 + 3 = 4x + 10

### Practice Problems
1. Simplify the equation a + b + c + d.

Using the commutative property, we can rearrange the terms in the equation:

a + b + c + d = a + c + b + d = a + c + d + b = (a + c) + (b + d) = (a + b) + (c + d)

2. Simplify the equation (3x + 4) + (2x + 5).

Using the associative property, we can rearrange the terms in the equation:

(3x + 4) + (2x + 5) = 3x + (4 + 2x) + 5 = 3x + (2x + 4) + 5 = 3x + 6 + 5 = 3x + 11

## H. Using Inverse Operations


### What Are Inverse Operations?
Inverse operations are mathematical operations that undo one another. For example, addition and subtraction are inverse operations because if you add a number to a given number and then subtract the same number, you will end up with the original number. Similarly, multiplication and division are inverse operations because if you multiply a number by a given number and then divide the result by the same number, you will end up with the original number.

### Using Inverse Operations
Inverse operations are useful for solving equations because they allow you to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. For example, if you have an equation such as `2x + 4 = 10`, you can use inverse operations to isolate the variable `x` on one side of the equation. To do this, you would subtract 4 from both sides of the equation, which would give you `2x = 6`. Then, you could divide both sides of the equation by 2, which would give you `x = 3`.

### Examples

Here are some examples of using inverse operations to solve equations:

**Example 1**

Solve the equation `3x – 2 = 14`

Solution:

1. Add 2 to both sides of the equation: `3x = 16`
2. Divide both sides of the equation by 3: `x = 16/3`
3. Simplify: `x = 5.33`

**Example 2**

Solve the equation `4x + 6 = 10`

Solution:

1. Subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: `4x = 4`
2. Divide both sides of the equation by 4: `x = 4/4`
3. Simplify: `x = 1`

### Practice Problems

1. Solve the equation `5x – 3 = 22`
2. Solve the equation `7x + 8 = 34`
3. Solve the equation `2x + 6 = 16`

### Solutions

1. Solution:

1. Add 3 to both sides of the equation: `5x = 25`
2. Divide both sides of the equation by 5: `x = 25/5`
3. Simplify: `x = 5`

2. Solution:

1. Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: `7x = 26`
2. Divide both sides of the equation by 7: `x = 26/7`
3. Simplify: `x = 3.71`

3. Solution:

1. Subtract 6 from both sides of the equation: `2x = 10`
2. Divide both sides of the equation by 2: `x = 10/2`
3. Simplify: `x = 5`

## I. Using Substitution

### Overview

Substitution is a method of solving an equation by replacing a variable with a known value. This method can be used to solve equations with one or more variables, and can be used in combination with other methods such as factoring or the quadratic formula.

### Examples

Let's look at a few examples of how substitution can be used to solve equations.

**Example 1**

Solve for x:

$$2x+3=7$$

We can use substitution to solve this equation. First, we need to find a value for x that we can substitute into the equation. Let's use the value x=2. Now, we can substitute this value into the equation:

$$2(2)+3=7$$

We can simplify this equation to get the solution:

$$4+3=7$$

Therefore, x=2 is the solution to the equation.

**Example 2**

Solve for y:

$$y+3=8$$

We can use substitution to solve this equation. First, we need to find a value for y that we can substitute into the equation. Let's use the value y=5. Now, we can substitute this value into the equation:

$$5+3=8$$

We can simplify this equation to get the solution:

$$5+3=8$$

Therefore, y=5 is the solution to the equation.

### Practice Problems

Now that you've seen a few examples of how substitution can be used to solve equations, let's try some practice problems.

**Problem 1**

Solve for x:

$$x-2=4$$

**Solution**

We can use substitution to solve this equation. First, we need to find a value for x that we can substitute into the equation. Let's use the value x=6. Now, we can substitute this value into the equation:

$$6-2=4$$

We can simplify this equation to get the solution:

$$6-2=4$$

Therefore, x=6 is the solution to the equation.

**Problem 2**

Solve for y:

$$y+5=12$$

**Solution**

We can use substitution to solve this equation. First, we need to find a value for y that we can substitute into the equation. Let's use the value y=7. Now, we can substitute this value into the equation:

$$7+5=12$$

We can simplify this equation to get the solution:

$$7+5=12$$

Therefore, y=7 is the solution to the equation.

## J. Using the Quadratic Formula

### Introduction

The quadratic formula is an essential tool for solving any quadratic equation. It is a formula that allows us to solve for the two roots of a quadratic equation, given the equation's coefficients. It is a simple formula that can be used to solve any quadratic equation.

### Quadratic Formula

The quadratic formula is expressed as:

```
x = (-b ± √b² - 4ac) / 2a
```

Where `a`, `b`, and `c` are the coefficients of the quadratic equation. The ± sign indicates that there are two possible solutions, one with the plus sign and one with the minus sign.

### Solving with the Quadratic Formula

To solve a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, first identify the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c`. Then plug them into the formula to calculate the two roots.

For example, consider the equation `2x² + 3x - 5 = 0`. The coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` are `a = 2`, `b = 3`, and `c = -5`. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

```
x = (-3 ± √3² - 4(2)(-5)) / 2(2)
  = (-3 ± √39) / 4
  = (-3 ± 6.55) / 4
  = (-0.75, 5.75)
```

So the two roots of the equation are `x = -0.75` and `x = 5.75`.

### Practice Problems

1. Solve the equation `3x² - 5x + 2 = 0` using the quadratic formula.

```
x = (-5 ± √5² - 4(3)(2)) / 2(3)
  = (-5 ± √29) / 6
  = (-5 ± 5.39) / 6
  = (-2.695, 0.695)
```

2. Solve the equation `4x² + 7x + 3 = 0` using the quadratic formula.

```
x = (-7 ± √7² - 4(4)(3)) / 2(4)
  = (-7 ± √61) / 8
  = (-7 ± 7.81) / 8
  = (-3.505, 0.495)
```

# 4. Linear Equations


## A. Definition of a Linear Equation


### What is a Linear Equation?
A linear equation is an equation of the form:

$$ax + b = 0$$

where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $x$ is a variable. This is the standard form of a linear equation.

Linear equations are used to model relationships between two or more variables. These equations can be used to describe a wide variety of situations, such as the distance-time relationship in physics, the supply and demand of a product in economics, or the cost of a service in business.

### Slope-Intercept Form
A linear equation can also be written in the slope-intercept form:

$$y = mx + b$$

where $m$ is the slope of the line and $b$ is the y-intercept.

The slope of a line is the rate of change of the y-values with respect to the x-values. It is the steepness of the line. A positive slope means that the line is rising and a negative slope means that the line is falling.

The y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis.

### Examples

1. $2x + 1 = 0$
2. $y = 5x - 3$

### Practice Problems

1. Write the equation $y = -\frac{3}{4}x + 2$ in standard form.

Answer: $-\frac{3}{4}x + y = 2$

2. Find the slope and y-intercept of the equation $y = -3x + 7$.

Answer: Slope = -3, y-intercept = 7

## B. Slope-Intercept Form of a Linear Equation


### Introduction

The slope-intercept form of a linear equation is one of the most commonly used forms for linear equations. It is written in the form:

$$ y = mx + b $$

Where **m** is the slope of the line, and **b** is the y-intercept of the line. The slope-intercept form makes it easy to identify the slope and y-intercept of a line, and it is useful for graphing linear equations.

### Slope

The slope of a line is a measure of its steepness, or how much it rises or falls for each unit it moves. It is calculated by taking two points on the line, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, and using the following formula:

$$ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} $$

The slope of a line can be positive, negative, zero, or undefined.

### Y-Intercept

The y-intercept of a line is the point at which the line crosses the y-axis. To find the y-intercept of a line, simply plug in **x** = 0 into the equation and solve for **y**.

### Graphing

To graph a line in slope-intercept form, first identify the slope and y-intercept of the line. Then, plot the y-intercept on the y-axis. From this point, use the slope to find a second point on the line. Connect the two points with a straight line.

### Example

Let's graph the line $y = 3x + 4$.

First, we need to identify the slope and y-intercept of the line. The slope is 3, and the y-intercept is 4.

Next, we plot the y-intercept on the y-axis. This point is (0, 4).

Finally, we use the slope to find a second point on the line. If we move one unit to the right, the line rises by 3 units. So, the second point is (1, 7).

We can now connect the two points with a straight line, and we have graphed the line.

### Practice Problems

1. Graph the line $y = -2x + 5$.
2. Graph the line $y = \frac{1}{2}x + 3$.
3. Graph the line $y = -3x - 4$.

### Solutions

1. The slope of this line is -2 and the y-intercept is 5. We plot the y-intercept on the y-axis at (0, 5). Then, we move one unit to the right and the line drops by two units. So, the second point is (1, 3). We connect the two points with a straight line and we have graphed the line.

2. The slope of this line is $\frac{1}{2}$ and the y-intercept is 3. We plot the y-intercept on the y-axis at (0, 3). Then, we move one unit to the right and the line rises by one-half unit. So, the second point is (1, 3.5). We connect the two points with a straight line and we have graphed the line.

3. The slope of this line is -3 and the y-intercept is -4. We plot the y-intercept on the y-axis at (0, -4). Then, we move one unit to the right and the line drops by three units. So, the second point is (1, -7). We connect the two points with a straight line and we have graphed the line.

## C. Graphing Linear Equations

### Definition of a Graph

A graph is a visual representation of a mathematical equation. A graph is composed of two axes, the x-axis and the y-axis, and the coordinates of the points that make up the graph. The x-axis is the horizontal axis and the y-axis is the vertical axis. The coordinates of a point on a graph can be written in the form (x,y).

### Graphing a Linear Equation

A linear equation is an equation that can be written in the form y = mx + b, where m and b are constants. To graph a linear equation, we first plot the y-intercept, which is the point where the line crosses the y-axis, and is written as (0,b). We then use the slope of the line, m, to find other points on the line. To do this, we choose a value for x, calculate the corresponding value for y, and plot the point. We then repeat this process for other values of x in order to plot more points on the line. Once we have plotted enough points, we can draw a line connecting them to create the graph of the linear equation.

### Example

Let's look at the equation y = 2x + 3. To graph this equation, we first plot the y-intercept, which is the point (0,3). We then use the slope, 2, to find other points on the line. For example, if x = 1, then y = 5, so we plot the point (1,5). If x = 2, then y = 7, so we plot the point (2,7). We can repeat this process for other values of x to plot more points on the line. Once we have plotted enough points, we can draw a line connecting them to create the graph of the equation.

### Practice Problems

1. Graph the equation y = 4x - 2
2. Graph the equation y = -3x + 5
3. Graph the equation y = -1/2x + 4

## D. Standard Form of a Linear Equation


### Introduction

A linear equation is an equation that can be written in the form of `ax + b = 0`, where `a` and `b` are constants. The standard form of a linear equation is `Ax + By = C`, where `A`, `B`, and `C` are constants. This form is useful for solving linear equations and graphing linear equations.

### Example

For example, the equation `3x + 4y = 8` can be written in standard form as `3x + 4y = 8`.

### Graphing

The standard form of a linear equation can be used to graph the equation. To graph the equation `Ax + By = C`, first plot the `x` and `y` intercepts. The `x` intercept is the point where the line crosses the `x` axis and is found by setting `y = 0` and solving for `x`. The `y` intercept is the point where the line crosses the `y` axis and is found by setting `x = 0` and solving for `y`.

Once the intercepts are found, plot them on a graph and draw a line that connects them. This line is the graph of the equation `Ax + By = C`.

### Solving

The standard form of a linear equation can also be used to solve the equation. To solve the equation `Ax + By = C`, first rearrange the equation to get `y` on one side and everything else on the other side. Then divide both sides by `B` to solve for `y`. Finally, substitute the value of `y` into the original equation and solve for `x`.

### Practice Problems

1. Graph the equation `3x + 4y = 12`.
2. Solve the equation `2x + 3y = 9`.

### Solutions

1. The `x` intercept is found by setting `y = 0` and solving for `x`: `3x + 4(0) = 12` → `3x = 12` → `x = 4`. The `y` intercept is found by setting `x = 0` and solving for `y`: `3(0) + 4y = 12` → `4y = 12` → `y = 3`. Plot the intercepts on a graph and draw a line that connects them. This line is the graph of the equation `3x + 4y = 12`.

2. Rearrange the equation to get `y` on one side and everything else on the other side: `2x + 3y = 9` → `3y = 9 - 2x` → `y = (9 - 2x)/3`. Divide both sides by `3` to solve for `y`: `y = (9 - 2x)/3` → `y = 3 - (2/3)x`. Substitute the value of `y` into the original equation and solve for `x`: `2x + 3(3 - (2/3)x) = 9` → `2x + 9 - 2x = 9` → `x = 3`. The solution is `x = 3` and `y = 3 - (2/3)x = 3 - (2/3)(3) = 3 - 2 = 1`.

## E. Writing Linear Equations from Graphs


### Introduction

Writing linear equations from graphs is a skill that is essential to understanding algebra. It allows us to interpret a graph visually and then translate it into an algebraic equation. This can be very useful for solving problems that involve linear equations.

### Slope-Intercept Form

The most common way to write a linear equation from a graph is using the **slope-intercept form**. This form of the equation is written as:

```
y = mx + b
```

Where `m` is the slope of the line and `b` is the y-intercept. To find the slope, we can look at two points on the graph and use the formula:

```
m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
```

To find the y-intercept, we can look at the graph and determine the point where the line crosses the y-axis.

### Example

Let's consider the following graph:

<img src="example-graph.png" width="400">

To write the equation for this graph, we first need to find the slope and y-intercept. We can pick any two points on the graph to calculate the slope. Let's choose the points (2, 4) and (4, 8). Using the formula above, we can calculate the slope as:

```
m = (8 - 4) / (4 - 2) = 4 / 2 = 2
```

Now we can look at the graph to find the y-intercept. We can see that the line crosses the y-axis at (0, -2). This means that the y-intercept is -2.

Using the slope and y-intercept, we can now write the equation for this graph in slope-intercept form:

```
y = 2x - 2
```

### Practice

Now that you understand how to write linear equations from graphs, try writing the equation for the following graphs.

1. <img src="practice-graph-1.png" width="400">

Answer:

```
y = -3x + 4
```

2. <img src="practice-graph-2.png" width="400">

Answer:

```
y = 3x - 6
```

## F. Solving Linear Equations


### Introduction

In this section, we will discuss how to solve linear equations. A linear equation is an equation that can be written in the form of `ax + b = 0`, where `a` and `b` are constants. The solution of a linear equation is the value of the variable that makes the equation true.

### Solving Linear Equations

To solve a linear equation, we must first isolate the variable on one side of the equation. This can be done by adding or subtracting the same number from both sides of the equation, or by multiplying or dividing both sides of the equation by the same number.

Once the variable is isolated, we can solve for the value of the variable by performing the inverse operation on both sides of the equation.

#### Example

For example, consider the equation `2x + 4 = 10`. To solve for `x`, we must first isolate `x` on one side of the equation. To do this, we can subtract `4` from both sides of the equation, resulting in `2x = 6`.

Now that `x` is isolated, we can solve for `x` by performing the inverse operation of multiplication on both sides of the equation. This will result in `x = 3`. Therefore, the solution of the equation `2x + 4 = 10` is `x = 3`.

#### Practice Problems

1. Solve for `x` in the equation `3x + 7 = 17`.
    - Solution: `x = 5`
2. Solve for `y` in the equation `2y - 4 = 8`.
    - Solution: `y = 6`
3. Solve for `z` in the equation `5z + 10 = 25`.
    - Solution: `z = 3`

## G. Solving Systems of Linear Equations


### What is a System of Linear Equations?

A system of linear equations is a set of two or more linear equations that have the same set of unknowns. Solving a system of linear equations involves finding the values of all the unknowns that satisfy all of the equations in the system.

### Methods for Solving Systems of Linear Equations

There are several methods for solving systems of linear equations. The most common methods are:

- **Elimination Method**: This method involves adding or subtracting the equations to eliminate one of the unknowns.
- **Substitution Method**: This method involves substituting one of the unknowns in one of the equations with its expression in terms of the other unknowns and then solving for the remaining unknowns.
- **Graphing Method**: This method involves graphing the equations in the system and finding the points of intersection.

### Example

Consider the following system of linear equations:

```
2x + y = 5
3x + 2y = 11
```

We can solve this system of equations using the elimination method. First, we add the two equations together to eliminate the variable y:

```
2x + y = 5
3x + 2y = 11

5x + 3y = 16
```

Next, we solve for x:

```
5x + 3y = 16

5x = 16 - 3y

x = (16 - 3y)/5
```

Finally, we substitute the expression for x into either of the original equations to solve for y:

```
2x + y = 5

2((16 - 3y)/5) + y = 5

2(16 - 3y) + 5y = 25

-8y = 9

y = -9/8
```

Therefore, the solution of the system of equations is x = (16 - 3y)/5 = (16 - 3(-9/8))/5 = 4 and y = -9/8.

### Practice Problems

1. Solve the following system of equations using the elimination method:

```
x + y = 5
2x + 4y = 8
```

Answer: x = 1 and y = 4

2. Solve the following system of equations using the substitution method:

```
2x - 5y = 7
3x + 2y = 9
```

Answer: x = 4 and y = -1

## H. Applications of Linear Equations

### Introduction
Linear equations are used in many different fields, including physics, engineering, economics, and more. In this section, we will explore some of the most common applications of linear equations.

### Balancing Chemical Equations
In chemistry, linear equations are used to balance chemical equations. A chemical equation is a representation of a chemical reaction, which is written in terms of the substances that are involved. In order for a chemical equation to be balanced, the number of atoms of each element on either side of the equation must be equal. This can be represented using linear equations.

For example, consider the following unbalanced chemical equation:

```
2H2 + O2 → 2H2O
```

To balance this equation, we can set up a system of linear equations:

```
2x + y = 2
2y = 1
```

Solving this system of equations, we find that x = 1 and y = 0.5, which gives us the balanced equation:

```
2H2 + O2 → 2H2O
```

### Economics
Linear equations are also used in economics to model the relationship between supply and demand. Supply and demand are two of the most fundamental concepts in economics, and they can be modelled using linear equations.

For example, consider a market where the supply and demand equations are given by:

```
Supply:  p = 10 + 2q
Demand:  p = 20 - 3q
```

Where p is the price of the good and q is the quantity of the good. To find the equilibrium price and quantity, we can set up a system of linear equations:

```
10 + 2q = 20 - 3q
2q + 3q = 20 - 10
5q = 10
q = 2
```

Then, substituting q = 2 into either of the equations, we find that p = 14. Therefore, the equilibrium price and quantity are p = 14 and q = 2.

### Engineering
Linear equations are also used in engineering to model physical systems. For example, consider a simple electrical circuit with a resistor and a capacitor. The voltage across the resistor and the capacitor can be modelled using a system of linear equations:

```
Vr = R*I
Vc = 1/C*I
```

Where Vr is the voltage across the resistor, Vc is the voltage across the capacitor, R is the resistance of the resistor, C is the capacitance of the capacitor, and I is the current flowing through the circuit.

### Practice Problems
1. Balance the following chemical equation:

```
C2H6 + O2 → CO2 + H2O
```

Answer:

```
2C2H6 + 7O2 → 4CO2 + 6H2O
```

2. Consider a market where the supply and demand equations are given by:

```
Supply:  p = 8 + 2q
Demand:  p = 20 - 3q
```

Find the equilibrium price and quantity.

Answer:

The equilibrium price and quantity can be found by setting up a system of linear equations:

```
8 + 2q = 20 - 3q
2q + 3q = 20 - 8
5q = 12
q = 2.4
```

Substituting q = 2.4 into either of the equations, we find that p = 16.8. Therefore, the equilibrium price and quantity are p = 16.8 and q = 2.4.
